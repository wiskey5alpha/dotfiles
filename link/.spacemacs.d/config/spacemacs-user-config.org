A configuration file to configure user settings for spacemacs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#+TITLE: Spacemacs User Configuration File
#+PROPERTY: header-args :comments org
#+PROPERTY: header-args :padline no
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle yes
#+STARTUP: hidestars overview
#+FILETAGS: spacemacs tangle dotfiles config

* Overview
  =.spacemacs.d/init.el= tangles and loads this file.
  This provides the =dotspacemacs/user-config ()= function.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; this file is automatically generated from ~/.spacemacs.d/config/spacemacs-user-config.org
    ;; any changes made here will be over written upon next startup
  #+END_SRC

* User config function
  Open the defun here, but be careful to ensure that it is closed at the bottom.

  This function is loaded after the =dotspacemacs/layers= function.  Any custom
  settings for the layer, or the included packages should be done here.
  *note* that [[~/.emacs.d/layers/auto-layer.el]] does some file association for
  layers.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  #+END_SRC

* Configuration Layers
   I want to keep this hierarchy and the layers hierarchy in sync as much as
  possible.  I think that'll make it easier to keep track of the load, and setup
  of each package.
** Emacs tools
*** better-defaults
    This package configures some features in spacemacs emacs mode (as opposed to
    the evil mode)
    Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E will move to the beginning/end of the code line, vice the
    text line

**** org modules and exporters
     Org mode is a system with many add-ons and features.  The Export function has
     many more options than what is set as default

**** org stuck-projects
     first, a project is loosely defined as an item that is:
     - A TODO item
     - not on the "someday maybe" list
     - not waiting for something else
     - not explicitly set to ignore
     - not in review
     - not scheduled
     Next
     - if it has a TODO item its not stuck (the lower one may be though)
     - if it has a NEXT item its not stuck

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq org-stuck-projects

        "-someday-wait-IGNORE-REVIEW/TODO"

        ("NEXT")
        ;; if these tags are found in the subitems, it is not stuck

        ""
       )

**** org tags
     Tags are used for two major functions; filtering and searching

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

**** org journal
     A journal management system using org.  It's enabled in
     [[file:spacemacs-layers.org::*Emacs tools][Emacs tools layer]]

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

**** org protocol
     Almost the best feature of org mode.  Enabling org-protocol lets me send
     clips to org from the browser

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (require 'org-protocol)
   #+END_SRC

**** Agenda files
     list of agenda files managed in the org directory.

     This will load all org files in the org directory
     into two lists :
     - First are the files required for the org-agenda
       - this should be =org-agenda-files=
     - The second is the directories used for search such as org-occur
       - this should be =org-agenda-text-search-extra-files=

     Next , because org only makes refile-targets from the
     =org-agenda-files= list we need to adjust that to include
     the Reference folder as well

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       ; set the default directory for some org functionality
       (setq org-directory "~/org")
       (setq org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/org/*.org"))
       (setq org-agenda-text-search-extra-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/org/notes/*.org"))
